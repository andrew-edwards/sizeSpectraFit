##' Plot binned ISD plots similar to MEPS Figure 7 (but with nonoverlapping
##' bins).
##'
##' TODO need xlab here and called functions
##'
##' Plots one- or two-panel plot of the ISD with data in binned form like in
##'   Fig. 7, 7a or 7b (depending on settings) of MEPS paper, but with
##'   nonoverlapping bins. See `log_y_axis` to specify exact plot(s).
##'
##' Also directly called from `plot.size_spectrum_mlebins()` with no
##' extra arugments for MLEbins method.
##'
##' @inheritParams plot.size_spectrum_numeric
##' @inheritParams plot_isd_binned
##' @param res_mlebin size_spectrum_mlebin object resulting from running
##'   `fit_size_spectrum()` on binned data (such that the function
##'   `fit_size_spectrum_mlebin()` is used; see vignette TODO). # TODO link help
##'   to plot.size_spectrum_numeric - may want to put them all together
##' @param log_y_axis TODO delete a bunch of these params.....character either `"both"`, do two plots (like Fig. 7 of
##'   MEPS paper), `"no"` for single plot with linear y axis (like Fig. 7a of
##'   MEPS paper), `"yes"` for single plot with logarithmic y axis (like Fig. 7b
##'   of MEPS paper). Legends are automatically set, but can be tailored with the
##'   arguments defined below.
##' @param legend_label_a character label (default `"(a)"`) to use for panel a for two-panel plot
##'   (`log_y_axis = "both"`).
##' @param legend_label_b character label to use for panel b for two-panel plot
##'   (`log_y_axis = "both"`).
##' @param legend_label_single character label to use for the only panel for a one-panel plot (`log_y_axis = "yes"` or `"no"`).
##' @param legend_text_a text to include in the legend for panel
##'   a for two-panel plot (`log_y_axis = "both"`), the `b = -1.58` in Fig. 7a
##'   of MEPS paper, or the only panel for a one-panel plot (`log_y_axis =
##'   "yes"` or `"no"`).
##' @param legend_text_b text to include in the legend for panel
##'   b for two-panel plot (`log_y_axis = "both"`); ignored for one-panel plot
##' @param legend_text_a_n, legend_text_b_n as for `legend_text_a` and
##'   `legend_text_b` but for another row of information, default being `n =
##'   <sample size>` as in Fig. 7a of MEPS paper.
##' @return one- or two-panel plot of the ISD with data in binned form like in
##'   Fig. 7, 7a or 7b (depending on settings) of MEPS paper, but with nonoverlapping bins; returns nothing.
