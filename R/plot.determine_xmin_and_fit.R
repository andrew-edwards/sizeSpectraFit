##' Plot results from determining xmin by mode method and then fitting use MLE hake spectra results

##' @param res list of class `determine_xmin_and_fit` as output from `determine_xmin_and_fit()`
##' @param xlim_hist numeric vector of two values representing `xlim` for histogram plot; default is the full range

##'   the linear axis). TODO could maybe add in log-x axis, but not option in
##'   `plot.hist()` so would have to make it up here.
