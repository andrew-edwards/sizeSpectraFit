##' Biomass size spectrum plot on log-log scale for body-mass data demonstrating
##' uncertainties
##'
##' Biomass size spectrum plot for binned data on a log-log scale like people
##' have been used to seeing. Shows the bin widths
##' explicitly and the normalised biomass in
##' each bin (with resulting uncertainties if applicable). So extending MEE Fig. 6 for already
##' binned data, using a new approach motivated by MEPS Fig. 7. Should probably
##' then be recommended to replace MEE Fig. 6. Axes are logged, and labelled as either
##' logged or (more intuitive) logged values. So it's an LBN-style plot but the
##' fitting is done using likelihood.
##'
##' If from the MLE method based on known individual body masses then there is
##' no uncertainty of the normalised biomass within each bin (no vertical
##' uncertainty on the plot). But if from the MLEbin method where the data are
##' already binned, then there is uncertainty and so we have uncertainty in the
##' vertical direction on the plot. Only appropriate for nonoverlapping bins.
##'
##' Adapting from `sizeSpectra::LBN_bin_plot()` and `plot_isd_binned()` (wanting
##' it consistent with the latter, but seemed better to make a new function).
##'
##' @param res results of class `size_spectrum_numeric` or
##' `size_spectrum_mlebin`
##'   ignore I think: TODO but if called
##'   from `plot.size_spectrum_numeric()` then the results are from the MLE
##'   method and do not have all the columns that would have from MLEbin method.
##' TODO onwards:
##' @param binValsTibble tibble of binned data with each row representing a bin
##'   and with columns `binMin` and `binMmax` (min and max break of each bin)
##'   and `binCount` (count in that bin), as in the `binVals` component of the
##'   output of `binData`. `wmin` and `wmax` can also be used instead of
##'   `binMin` and `binMax`. Extra columns are ignored.
##' @param binBreaks vector of bin breaks
##' @param binCounts vector of bin counts
##' @param b.MLE maximum likelihood estimate of *b* (ideally from the MLEbin method)
##' @param b.confMin lower 95\% confidence limits of *b*
##' @param b.confMax upper 95\% confidence limits of *b*
##' @param plot.binned.fitted if TRUE then also plot the estimated normalised
##'   biomass in each bin for the MLE of *b* and it's confidence limits
##' @param log.xy Which axes to log, for `plot(..., log = log.xy)`. So "xy" for
##'   log-log axes, "x" for only x-axis logged, "" for both axes unlogged.
##' @param leg.pos position of legend, from "bottomright"', '"bottom"',
##'   '"bottomleft"', '"left"', '"topleft"', '"top"', '"topright"', '"right"'
##'   and '"center"'.
##' @param inset_label inset distance vector for legend
##' @param legend_text text for legend TODO
##' @param ... further arguments to be passed to `plot()` and
##'   `plot_binned_fitted()`
##' @return TODO should return a tibble of results
