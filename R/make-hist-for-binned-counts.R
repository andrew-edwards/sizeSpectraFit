##' Take a tibble with `bin_min`, `bin_max`, and `bin_count` and assign counts
##' to new equal bins based on `bin_min`, summing the original counts (which can
##' be non-integer)
##'
##' Called from `determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins()` to determine xmin for MLEbins
##' method, and should work for MLEbin
##' method also TODO. Adapting from `sizeSpectraFit::make_hist()` and
##' sizeSpectraHake::make_hist()`, think the first was adapted from the former,
##' for simple counts, but now we want the more complex latter version for
##' binned data.
##'
##' Makes results a histogram list object and create 0 counts for missing bins.
##'
##' Can then use `plot()` which calls `plot.histogram()`. Without the 0 counts for missing bins
##' `plot.histogram()` does not plot counts because bins appear to have unequal widths.
##'
##' @param dat_for_mlebins  tibble of data in the format required for fitting
##'   using MLEbins method. TODO can join up with `determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins()`
##' @param bin_width numeric bin width to fit a histogram to help determine xmin
##' @param bin_start numeric value for the first bin to start at; if `NULL` then
##'   is set to the highest multiple of `bin_width` value below `min(dat_for_mlebins$bin_min)`.
##' @return a histogram list object with components (see `?hist`):
##'  - `breaks`
##'  - `mids`
##'  - `counts`
##'  - `xname`
##'  - `equidist` TRUE since have equal bin widths
