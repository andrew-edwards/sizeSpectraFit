##' Add horizontal bars and shaded rectangles to `plot_lbn_style()`
##'
##' These are to show the estimated normalised biomasses in each bin, based on
##' the MLE value of `b` and it's confidence limit values.
##' Each horizontal bar spans a bin (default colour is red), with it's vertical value indicating the
##' expected normalised biomass based on the MLE of `b`. The height of the
##' shaded rectangles (default colour pink) show the range of expected
##' normalised biomass based on the 95\% confidence interval of `b`.
##' @param dat tibble of values calculated in `plot_lbn_style()`; this
##' function adds to that plot
##' @param bar_col colour for the horizontal bars representing the MLE values of
##' normalised biomass in each bin
##' @param bar_lwd thickness of horiztonal bars
##' @param rect_shading colour for shading of rectangles corresponding to the
##' normalised biomasses estimated from confidence intervals of `b`
##' @param shorter fraction shorter to make the rectangles, so can see them
##' overlapping with grey rectangles; may not work exacly as planned (won't be symmetric) when x-axis
##' not logged, but that's not going to be a useful plot anyway
