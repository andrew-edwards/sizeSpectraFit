##' Do an aggregated MLEbin plot of several PLB fits, each to a separate (but related)
##' group of individuals.
##'
##' TODO forcussing on MLEbins first, but should be general enough but need
##' testing for MLEbin. This is copying [plot_aggregate] and then editing.
##'
##' TODO Am making plot_aggregate_mlebin() and maybe
##'   plot_aggregate_mlebins(), though prob best to make the latter the same,
##'   and don't want the green lines as a bit too confusing maybe.; could check
##'   the class here and have a general outfacing function,
##' or also make plot_aggregate_numeric and just call
##'   the right one. Some of the details could be shared here maybe.
##'
##' Given a list of MLEbin results, combine
##' the data and show an aggregated distribution, as well as the individual fits.
##'
##'
##' @param res_list list of results, with each component a list object of a
##'   given type TODO share help with plot-aggregate.
##' @param col_vec vector of colours to assign for each group
##' @return list with two objects, `x_plb_agg` and `y_plb_agg`, which are the
##'   fitted x and y values for the aggregated size spectrum (which does not
##'   have a simple exponent). To then use for plotting multiple strata in [plot_aggregate_fits()].
