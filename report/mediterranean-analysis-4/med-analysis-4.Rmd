HERE - Fix some TODOs, including figure
scaling. Maybe change some variable names to things more sensible. Carry on with
other species groups and compare previous one for understanding.

When doing the MLEbins vignette realised that had not properly considered the
length resolutions. Did some analysis in mediterranean-analysis-4/med-analysis-length-resolution.Rmd concluding that:

**Crustacea for baseline were to nearest 0.01 mm**

**Crustacea for FG and NTR were measured to nearest 0.1 mm (with a very few minor exceptions).**

**All non-crustacea are measured to nearest 1 mm (except one measurement that
doesn't matter)**

So here updating the analysis from mediterranean-analysis-3. Now need to do the
calculation of length bin min and max separately for each type of data (could do
once up front but a bit fiddly). Also rewrote `calc_max_of_bin()` as new
function to
return a tibble, so user doesn't have to join things up.

For analysis-3, this is after setting xmin to be the min `bin_min` value above the histogram
determined minimum. Now removing the big fish. For Actin, big fish are very
rare, not really sampling for them. Bit random to catch
them, so suggest removing. We agreed a cut off of 1500 g because of the gaps
in the sizes. Nothing between 1335 and 2396, clear gap. Can see details below.

Data are saved in the package. Doing MLEbins on full community and then each
species group in turn. Not worth fully functionalising as have to manually check
some things.

In earlier analysis we had looked at determining a global xmin and xmax within
each strata, but this ends up throwing out a lot of data (lots of small fish),
so going to stick with determining xmin using the modal approach independently
for each strata within a group. This is what we did for the North Sea data in
the MEPS paper.

Copy and pasting analysis for a particular species group, then just find and
replacing the group name and the short name. Need to examine results and so
can't just make one giant function. The later groups are probably best to use as
templates as the analyses and code got refined along the way.

## Data

We have data and the length-weight coefficients saved in a standard form in the
package, and also knowledge of the accuracty of the measurements. We need to
combine these to get the inputs required for MLEbins, namely counts in each
species-specific weight bin.

So we have three pieces of information. First is the measurements:
```{r medcalcs}
options(pillar.sigfig = 6)   # show 6 sig figs when printing tibbles (so can see
                             # length resolutions, but not overwhelmed by
                             # details for bin_min and bin_max
mediterranean_data
summary(mediterranean_data)
```
which we want to fit the size spectrum for each strata-group
combination. The data can have repeated measurements for the same
strata-group-length combination. We will aggregate such examples at the analysis
stage.

Second piece is the definition of lengths, as discussed above.
Lengths are assumed to be midpoints (e.g. 10 mm represents
9.5-10.5 mm).

Thirdly, we have species-specific length-weight coefficients.
```{r lwcoeffs}
mediterranean_length_weight_coefficients
```
which assume units of cm (not mm) and grammes.

Could amalgamate the data early, for duplicated strata-group-species-length
combinations, just sum the numbers. Does get done in MLEbins but makes sense to
do straight away before doing lots of calculations. Want to check results first.
Though this does move things out of order, so might be good to avoid, and keep
the data close to how it is originally saved.
Something like this but NOT RUNNING:

```{r, amalgamate, eval = FALSE}
dat_amalgamate <- dplyr::summarise(group_by(mediterranean_data,
                                            strata,
                                            group,
                                            species,
                                            length),
                                   number = sum(number)) %>%
  ungroup()
dat_amalgamate   # would need to verify, and check why the message only mentions three summaries
```

## Convert length measurements into length bins and then body-mass bins

Had thought might want to leave the length bins min and max calculations to the
strata-group specific analyses, but need to do up front to then look at what
large sporadic values to exclude (though they are all Actinopterygii, but good
to have this more general).

Could functionalise this, but worth doing in steps since other data sets will
have subtleties specific to them.

Given the three different measurement protocols, it seems best to split the data
into the three sets, calculate the bins, then bind them back together. Then do
the body-mass conversions.

**Crustacea for baseline were to nearest 0.01 mm**

```{r lengthbinscrustbaseline}
crust_baseline <- dplyr::filter(mediterranean_data,
                                strata == "baseline",
                                group == "Crustacea")

crust_baseline_with_breaks <- calc_bin_breaks(crust_baseline,
                                              bin_width = 0.01)

crust_baseline_with_breaks
```

**Crustacea for FG and NTR were measured to nearest 0.1 mm (with a very few minor exceptions).**

```{r lengthbinscrustfgntr}
crust_fg_ntr <- dplyr::filter(mediterranean_data,
                              strata %in% c("fg", "ntr"),
                              group == "Crustacea")

crust_fg_ntr_with_breaks <- calc_bin_breaks(crust_fg_ntr,
                                            bin_width = 0.1)

crust_fg_ntr_with_breaks
```

**All non-crustacea are measured to nearest 1 mm (except one measurement that
doesn't matter)**

```{r lengthbinsnon}
non_crust <- dplyr::filter(mediterranean_data,
                           group != "Crustacea")

non_crust_with_breaks <- calc_bin_breaks(non_crust,
                                         bin_width = 1)

non_crust_with_breaks
```

Then combine them back into one tibble:
```{r, combine}
dat_with_breaks <- rbind(crust_baseline_with_breaks,
                         crust_fg_ntr_with_breaks,
                         non_crust_with_breaks)
```

Confirm that the summaries match (orders of factors get retained):
```{r confirm}
expect_equal(summary(mediterranean_data),
             summary(dplyr::select(dat_with_breaks,
                                   -c("length_bin_min",
                                      "length_bin_max"))))
```

### Now to construct body-mass bins

Now use the length-weight coefficients to construct the body-mass bins. First
need to rename the `number` column to be `bin_count` (required by `length_bins_to_body_mass_bins()`):
```{r bodymassbins}
dat_with_breaks <- dplyr::rename(dat_with_breaks,
                                 bin_count = number)
dat_joined <-
  length_bins_to_body_mass_bins(dat_with_breaks,
                                mediterranean_length_weight_coefficients,
                                length_data_unit = "mm")
dat_joined

dat_joined[1:5, ] %>% a()
```

Useful for users to see all the values, even though only some of it is
needed for the likelihood fitting. There are less rows than the original data;
presumably these are only due to species that do not have length-weight
coefficients (such rows of data get excluded in
`length_bins_to_body_mass_bins()`. Just check that:

```{r, checkspecies}
dat_with_breaks_sp <- unique(dat_with_breaks$species)
dat_joined_sp <- unique(dat_joined$species)

sp_excluded <- setdiff(dat_with_breaks_sp,
                       dat_joined_sp)

dat_sp_excluded <- dplyr::filter(dat_with_breaks,
                                 species %in% sp_excluded)
dat_sp_excluded

# This has difference of 6
#expect_equal(nrow(dat_with_breaks),
#             nrow(dat_joined) + nrow(dat_sp_excluded))

sp_excluded_but_with_length_weight <- intersect(sp_excluded,
                                                mediterranean_length_weight_coefficients$species)

dplyr::filter(dat_with_breaks,
              species %in% sp_excluded_but_with_length_weight)
dplyr::filter(mediterranean_length_weight_coefficients,
              species %in% sp_excluded_but_with_length_weight)
```

TODO - just figure out where those 6 numbers went. Carry on as won't be hugely consequential.

There are very few large individuals, and these are all fish:
```{r, largefish}
dplyr::arrange(dat_joined, weight_bin_min) %>%
  dplyr::select(-c("length", "length_bin_min", "length_bin_max", "alpha",
                   "beta", "weight_bin_max")) %>%
    tail(n=25) %>%
    a()
```

Can see a gradual increase in weights, but then a clear jump between 1334
and 2395. The largest 12 measurements are all occasional rare individual fish,
which are going to be sporadically caught. Given that, and the big jump, we
determined that removing fish $>1500$~g is a sensible thing to do. Do it here in
the data processing stage so it's done throughout.

```{r, largefish2}
dat_joined <- dplyr::filter(dat_joined,
                            weight_bin_min <= 1500)
```
That will get used in all the analyses.

# Full community

Doing full community of values, which is okay because the sampling protocol
(trawl fishing) is the same
for each species group and the counts are standardised to be numbers per
km$^2$. For species groups, copying and pasting the analyses and then just
changing the group names (need to see everything and not worth it to functionalise
it all).

## Full Community baseline (takes a while)

```{r, fullbaseline}
# This function extracts the required data and returns what is needed for
# MLEbins; keeps species column for understanding even though not strictly
# needed for MLEbins.
data_full_baseline <- mediterranean_for_mlebins(dat_joined,
                                                strata_name = "baseline")

res_full_baseline <- determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_full_baseline)

res_full_baseline$mlebins_fit      # full list includes histogram values which
                                   # are not a tibble (am printing them all for
                                   # some later species groups).
```

```{r, fullbaselineplot}
plot(res_full_baseline,
     xlim_hist = c(0, 60),
     main = "Full Community baseline",
     seg_col = "black")

```

## Full Community fg

```{r, fullfg}
data_full_fg <- mediterranean_for_mlebins(dat_joined,
                                          strata_name = "fg")

res_full_fg <- determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_full_fg)

res_full_fg$mlebins_fit      # full list includes histogram values which
                                   # are not a tibble (am printing them all for
                                   # some later species groups).
```

```{r, fullfgplot}
plot(res_full_fg,
     xlim_hist = c(0, 60),
     main = "Full Community FG",
     seg_col = "black")
```

## Full Community ntr all data (suggests removing the smallest, so doing that after this)

Appendng with `_all` before removing the outlier small value and redoing.

```{r, fullntrall}
data_full_ntr_all <- mediterranean_for_mlebins(dat_joined,
                                               strata_name = "ntr")

res_full_ntr_all <- determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_full_ntr_all)

res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit      # full list includes histogram values which
                                   # are not a tibble (am printing them all for
                                   # some later species groups).
```

```{r, fullntrallplot}
plot(res_full_ntr_all,
     xlim_hist = c(0, 60),
     main = "Full Community NTR_ALL",
     seg_col = "black")
```

This figure looks strange, in the data do not show the usual spanning all the
way down to the lowest value ($x_{min}$). The plotting code is working
correctly. It's just that the first bins are very small:
```{r, fullntralldetails}
res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data %>% filter(bin_min < 0.5)
```
The first bin gets overplotted by the red line, and the second bin is in fact
the lowest one that can be seen around 0.4 on the x-axis.
Can see a bit more clearly in these figures, the second of which exaggerates the
first two bins:

```{r, fullntrallplot2}
plot.size_spectrum_mlebin(res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit,
                          xlim = c(0.1, 0.5))  # note plot..._mlebin
```


```{r, fullntrallplot3}
plot.size_spectrum_mlebin(res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit,
                          xlim = c(0.1, 0.5))  # note plot..._mlebin
ind <- 1
rect(xleft = res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data[ind, "bin_min"],
       #exaggerate bin:
     ybottom = res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data[ind, "low_count"] * 0.01,
     xright = res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data[ind, "bin_max"],
     ytop = res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data[ind, "high_count"],
     col = "green")
ind <- 2
rect(xleft = res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data[ind, "bin_min"],
     ybottom = res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data[ind, "low_count"] * 0.01,
     xright = res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data[ind, "bin_max"],
     ytop = res_full_ntr_all$mlebins_fit$data[ind, "high_count"],
     col = "pink")
```

Given the gap between the first two bins, suggests removing the lowest bin and
refitting. Does not make sense to fit to such an outlier (hard to automate that
though).

## Full Community ntr having removed outlier

Check it's just the one count to remove, yes it is:
```{r, fullntrcheck}
data_full_ntr_all %>% arrange(bin_min)

data_full_ntr <- dplyr::filter(data_full_ntr_all,
                               bin_min > 0.35)
data_full_ntr %>% arrange(bin_min)
```

Now do the analysis without the outlier:
```{r, fullntr}
res_full_ntr <- determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_full_ntr)

res_full_ntr$mlebins_fit      # full list includes histogram values which
                              # are not a tibble (am printing them all for
                              # some later species groups).
```

```{r, fullntrplot}
plot(res_full_ntr,
     xlim_hist = c(0, 60),
     main = "Full Community NTR",
     seg_col = "black")
```


## Compare strata for full community

Now to compare the three strata for full community.

TODO move to a function
```{r, fullsumm}
add_row_to_summary_table <- function(summary, res, group, strata){
  rbind(summary,
        dplyr::tibble("Group" = group,
                      "Strata" = strata,
                      "x_min" = res$mlebins_fit$x_min,
                      "x_max" = res$mlebins_fit$x_max,
                      "Low b" = res$mlebins_fit$b_conf[1],
                      "MLE b" = res$mlebins_fit$b_mle,
                      "High b" = res$mlebins_fit$b_conf[2]))
}

res_table_full <- dplyr::tibble()
res_table_full <- add_row_to_summary_table(res_table_full,
                                      res_full_baseline,
                                      "Full community",
                                      "Baseline")

res_table_full <- add_row_to_summary_table(res_table_full,
                                      res_full_fg,
                                      "Full community",
                                      "fg")
res_table_full <- add_row_to_summary_table(res_table_full,
                                      res_full_ntr,
                                      "Full community",
                                      "ntr")
```

Results combined are:

```{r, resfulltable}
knitr::kable(res_table_full, digits = 2)
```

So for the full community, from the baseline, the size spectrum steepens (more
negative $b$) in the fishing grounds, but shallows (less negative $b$) in the
no-take reserve, consistent with theory.

I had thought we shouldn't really analyse the full community
together due to different sampling protocols, but text at the start seems to
imply not so bad; think Juliana had further justification for splitting up.

# Crustacea

## Crustacea baseline

```{r, crustbaseline}
data_crust_baseline <- mediterranean_for_mlebins(dat_joined,
                                                 group_name = "Crustacea",
                                                 strata_name = "baseline")

res_crust_baseline <- determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_crust_baseline)

plot(res_crust_fg,
     xlim_hist = c(0, 60),
     main = "Crustacea FG")
```

## Crustacea NTR

As for full community NTR, need to remove Aegaeon lacazei as an outlier
(including it gives similar plot here to that earlier).

```{r, crustntr}
data_crust_ntr <- mediterranean_for_mlebins(dat_joined,
                                            group_name = "Crustacea",
                                            strata_name = "ntr") %>%
  dplyr::filter(bin_min > 0.35)

res_crust_ntr <- determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_crust_ntr)

res_crust_ntr$mlebins_fit
```

```{r, crustntrplot}
plot(res_crust_ntr,
     xlim_hist = c(0, 60),
     main = "Crustacea NTR")

Now to compare the three strata for Crustacea.

```{r, crustsumm}
res_table_crust <- dplyr::tibble()
res_table_crust <- add_row_to_summary_table(res_table_crust,

                                      "ntr")
```

Results combined are:

```{r, rescrusttable}
knitr::kable(res_table_crust, digits = 2)

As for full community, from the baseline, the size spectrum steepens (more
negative $b$) in the fishing grounds, but shallows (less negative $b$) slightly
(confidence intervals do not overlap) in the
no-take reserve, consistent with theory.

From the baseline, the size spectrum steepens (more

much (unlike for the Crustacea above).

From the baseline, the size spectrum steepens (more
negative $b$) in the fishing grounds, and also steepens strongly in the NTR, but
the $x_{min}$ is much higher. Not too clear what to do here, as $x_{min}$ are
quite different between all three, and hard to see a consistent value to use.

but shallows (less negative $b$) slightly
(confidence intervals do not overlap) in the
no-take reserve, consistent with theory.

Steepening size spectrum from the baseline, but then big steepening

# Cephalopoda (all)

Analyse the full Cephalopoda data in one go first, but this will show up the
clear distinction with a gap with very very few individuals. This is due to the
small and large being different species. Then work out how to split into small
and large.

## Determine cephalopod small/large cutoff

Now repeat the above for small and large separately, since the
first baseline plot clearly suggests a natural break. Explicitly this is at
20.89, with fg and ntr saying maybe something similar. 24 might be a sensible
consistent way of breaking up the data, but 20.89 seems more
obvious and occurs for all (so makes sense to use it for xmin).
Specifically 20.892555.... And doing $\geq$ that value for large.

Here are all the data:
```{r, cephallbaselinebreak}
dplyr::arrange(data_cephall_baseline, bin_min) %>% a()

dplyr::arrange(data_cephall_fg, bin_min) %>% a()

dplyr::arrange(data_cephall_ntr, bin_min) %>% a()

# And the rows in each for that xmin suggestion are:
ceph_small_large_delineation <- dplyr::filter(data_cephall_baseline,
                                              species == "Illex coindetii",
                                              bin_min > 20,
                                              bin_min < 21)$bin_min  # to get
                                              # the exact value

ceph_small_large_delineation

dplyr::filter(data_cephall_baseline,
              species == "Illex coindetii",
              bin_min == ceph_small_large_delineation)
dplyr::filter(data_cephall_fg,
              species == "Illex coindetii",
              bin_min == ceph_small_large_delineation)
dplyr::filter(data_cephall_ntr,
              species == "Illex coindetii",
              bin_min == ceph_small_large_delineation)
```

Okay, use that for delineating small/big organisms. Use that to define the data
to be analysed, still determine xmin and xmax in the usual way.

## Cephalopoda (small) baseline

data_cephsmall_baseline <- dplyr::filter(data_cephall_baseline,

max(data_cephsmall_baseline$bin_min)

res_cephsmall_baseline <-
  determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_cephsmall_baseline)
```

res_cephsmall_fg <- determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_cephsmall_fg)
```

```{r, cephsmallfgplot}

res_cephsmall_ntr <- determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins(data_cephsmall_ntr)
```

```{r, cephsmallntrplot}
plot(res_cephsmall_ntr,
     xlim_hist = c(0, 21),
     main = "Cephalopoda (small) NTR")
```

Now to compare the three strata for Cephalopoda (small):

```{r, cephsmallsumm}
res_table_cephsmall <- dplyr::tibble()

                                      "Cephalopoda small",
                                      "Baseline")

res_table_cephsmall <- add_row_to_summary_table(res_table_cephsmall,
                                      res_cephsmall_fg,
                                      "Cephalopoda small",
                                      "fg")
res_table_cephsmall <- add_row_to_summary_table(res_table_cephsmall,
                                      res_cephsmall_ntr,

                                      "ntr")
```

Go the opposite direction to theory, though Juliana had a biological explanation.

# Combining results

For each of baseline, FG, and NTR, can we produce an aggregated plot. Based on
what I figured out in 'Aggregating size spectra' document. Here just focus on
developing the code, based somewhat on that and code developed then.

First, let's create a table of the main results from above that we want to move
forward with. Just from the `res_table_***` objects. Then we'll need the raw
data from each in turn. Could then functionalise this maybe, but probably best
to keep explicit and tailored for different applications. Aggregated plots done
in `med-analysis.Rmd`.

```{r, aggregatetable}
res_table_agg <- rbind(res_table_full,
                       res_table_crust,
                       res_table_actin,
                       res_table_chondr,
                       res_table_cephsmall,
                       res_table_cephlarge)


knitr::kable(res_table_agg,
             digits = 2)
```

## Aggregated fit to data

Now just saving the results for each strata in a list. (See end of file for what
I originally did). Can include the full results (fitting in one go).

Each object is of class `determine_xmin_and_fit_mlebins`.

```{r, aggregatefitnew}

## Saving what is needed for plots and tables, and doing in med-summary.Rmd

```{r, savingnew}
saveRDS(baseline_agg_list,
        "baseline_agg_list.rds")
saveRDS(fg_agg_list,
        "fg_agg_list.rds")
saveRDS(ntr_agg_list,
        "ntr_agg_list.rds")
```

```{r, exit, cache = FALSE}
knitr::knit_exit()
```


## Aggregated fit to data (OLD, what was done but now just saving the results more simply above and doing further analyses in summary.Rmd)

Not saving the full analyses in here, just the separate groups of interest;
including the full analyses means that the aggregated values then double count
all the data, and will mess up the plotting.
```{r, aggregatefit}
baseline_agg <- aggregate_mlebins(list(crust = res_crust_baseline,
                                       actin = res_actin_baseline,
                                       chondr = res_chondr_baseline,
                                       cephsmall = res_cephsmall_baseline,
                                       cephlarge = res_cephlarge_baseline),
                                  res_table_agg,
                                  strata = "Baseline")

fg_agg <- aggregate_mlebins(list(crust = res_crust_fg,
                                 actin = res_actin_fg,
                                 chondr = res_chondr_fg,
                                 cephsmall = res_cephsmall_fg,
                                 cephlarge = res_cephlarge_fg),
                            res_table_agg,
                            strata = "fg")

ntr_agg <- aggregate_mlebins(list(crust = res_crust_ntr,
                                  actin = res_actin_ntr,
                                  chondr = res_chondr_ntr,
                                  cephsmall = res_cephsmall_ntr,
                                  cephlarge = res_cephlarge_ntr),
                             res_table_agg,
                             strata = "ntr")
```

Each one is saved as a `mlebins_list object` to then create plotting function.
