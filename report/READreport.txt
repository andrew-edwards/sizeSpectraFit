mediterranean-analysis-1/ - first attempts based on Juliana's code, doing
  individual body masses and MLE, but that doesn't take into account standardisation
  that gives non-integer counts.

mediterranean-analysis-2/ - pdf as discussed in our chat on 8/5/25. Figuring out
  functionalisation and plotting and tables using MLEbins, with
  different xmin and xmax approaches. Had excluded <100 mm, and
  had kept in all fish but not going to now.
  Have confirmed that the running of meditteranean-data.Rmd (renamed from
  data-raw/zabala-data.Rmd) has not change the data .rda files, so this code
  should still produce the same results (8/5/25, check the commit dates of .rda
  files if looking to fully reproduce the results). Not committing; if want
  early version then get first version of
  mediterranean-analysis-3/med-analysis.Rmd and med_summary.Rmd, as they are
  copied into that directory before editing.

mediterranean-analysis-3/
 med-analysis.Rmd - renaming and adapting med...-2/zabala-data-analysis.Rmd,
 med-summary.Rmd from - renaming and adapting med...-2/zabala-summary.Rmd.
 Doing what we discussed in the 8/5/25 discussion.
