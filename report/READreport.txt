mediterranean-analysis-1/ - first attempts based on Juliana's code, doing
  individual body masses and MLE, but that doesn't take into account standardisation
  that gives non-integer counts.

mediterranean-analysis-2/ - pdf as discussed in our chat on 8/5/25. Figuring out
  functionalisation and plotting and tables using MLEbins, with
  different xmin and xmax approaches. Had excluded <100 mm, and
  had kept in all fish but not going to now.
  Note that rerunning this now might give different results if the .rda data
  file has changed. Don't think it will (check the commit date), but I have to
  re-run data-raw/zabala-data.Rmd (I'll rename it meditteranean-data.Rmd) as I
  seemed to have run the code but not rebuilt the pdf.

mediterranean-analysis-3/ - med-analysis.Rmd - renaming and adapting
 med...-2/zabala-data-analysis.Rmd, same for med-summary.Rmd from
 med...-2/zabala-summary.Rmd.
 Doing what we discussed in the 8/5/25 discussion.
