mediterranean-analysis-1/ - first attempts based on Juliana's code, doing
  individual body masses and MLE, but that doesn't take into account standardisation
  that gives non-integer counts.

mediterranean-analysis-2/ - pdf as discussed in our chat on 8/5/25. Figuring out
  functionalisation and plotting and tables using MLEbins, with
  different xmin and xmax approaches. Had excluded <100 mm, and
  had kept in all fish but not going to now.
  Have confirmed that the running of meditteranean-data.Rmd (renamed from
  data-raw/zabala-data.Rmd) has not change the data .rda files, so this code
  should still produce the same results (8/5/25, check the commit dates of .rda
  files if looking to fully reproduce the results). Not committing; if want
  early version then get first version of
  mediterranean-analysis-3/med-analysis.Rmd and med_summary.Rmd, as they are
  copied into that directory before editing.

mediterranean-analysis-3/
 med-analysis.Rmd - renaming and adapting med...-2/zabala-data-analysis.Rmd,
 med-summary.Rmd from - renaming and adapting med...-2/zabala-summary.Rmd.
 Doing what we discussed in the 8/5/25 discussion.

 saving the .pdfs with new filenames in these:
 - xmin-still-integer/ - results saved (with <100 mm not excluded but big fish still
   included)  while still having xmin be the min of the
   integer bin, before changing to min bin_min above the min of the integer
   bin. Want to keep this to compare the changed version to see if it makes a
   difference.

 - xmin-not-integer/ above run but setting xmin to be the min bin_min above the
   histogram determined version. Should note that when describing histograms.
   NOT COMPARED wiht previous yet, copying over and running the no-large-fish
   fun.

mediterranean-analysis-4/
 Rerunning with corrected length resolutions (0.01, 0.1, 1 mm), as explained at
 the start of med-analysis.Rmd. Originally figured out in MLEbins vignette but now doing
 here first.
 xmin is the min `bin_min` value above the histogram (1-g bins) determined minimum
 med-analysis-length-resolution.Rmd - explains all that.
 med-analysis-4.Rmd - redoing the analysis.
 med-summary-4.Rmd - summarising results and doing aggregate plots, found some
 code from May 2025.

 Rerunning from scratch before doing analysis-5. Took 50 minutes to run.

From chatting with Juliana on 19/8/25, decided to (see below for explicit plan):

Crustacea - fix xmin across strata, using each of the three values that come
out. Makes sense for crustacea. May as well do same assumption for full
community, since xmin values are the same as those for crustacea.
Also xmax, maybe biggest of each.

Actin (small fish) - try both xmin.

Crust and fish appear much better in NTR (from being out on the water), so 'suspicious' of results.

Sharks like disturbed grounds so can find in FG. Try both xmin, not the big one
(will probably do for completeness).

Cephalopod small and large - also change xmin. Expect maybe doing worse as not
commercial species, just there, and not that many.

She mentioned that xmin = 0.2 worked well for her in the past analysis, sounds
low, could try a global xmin of something low?

--

Going to work through the assumptions, starting assuming the baseline xmin, then
the FG xmin, then the NTR xmin (based on Table on p84 of analysis-4). Will need a few .Rmd files, but gradually
whittle down the analyses in each as won't need everything.

Simplify 4 to use as 5 as a template (can shorten the initial part), and then
  use for 6,7,8.

Decide as go along whether to just rerun all results (even though some will be
  duplicated analyses) - probably easiest to just do and just wait for them to
  run. Will also allow confirmation, and automatically build the tables and
  summary plots when done. And .pdfs will all look similar.

So continuing based on 4, but, based on those results, trying
  different approaches for xmin as a sensitivity, to see how results change with
  xmin assumption.

mediterranean-analysis-5/
  baseline xmin for each group (make notes in .Rmd) . Obtain automatically from version 4 results.

  In 4 we did the histograms (1-g width) and used xmin as the minimum bin_min
  within the modal histogram bin.


mediterranean-analysis-6/
  use 5 as template
  fg xmin for each.


mediterranean-analysis-7/
  use 5 or 6 as template.
  ntr xmin for each

mediterranean-analysis-8/
  do a global xmin of the value obtained for the global community, namely
  1.01...  Use for all fits for consistency.




mediterranean-analysis-8/
decide on base case of the above, and do sensitivity to xmax; just set xmax
within each group to be the max of the xmax.

mediterranean-analysis-9/
do a global xmin of something low. Maybe 1 or 2.
