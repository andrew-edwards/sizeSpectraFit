\arguments{
\item{res_tib}{tibble that includes columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Group}: a group of related species for the Mediterranean data
\item \code{Strata}:three different scenarios for the Mediterranean data:
\itemize{
\item Baseline: before the no-take-reserve implemented)
\item FG: fishing grounds outside the no-take-reserve
\item NTR: inside the no-take-reserve
}
\item \verb{Low b}: the 95\\% lower confidence limit of the exponent \emph{b}
\item \verb{MLE b}: the maximum likelihood estimate of \emph{b}
\item \verb{High b} the 95\\% upper confidence limit of \emph{b}
}}

\item{col_strata}{character vector of colours, need one colour for each strata}

\item{pch_strata}{vector of pch numeric values, one for each strata}

\item{pch_cex}{numeric, size of the points, gets used by \code{points(..., cex = pch_cex)}}

\item{shade_first}{logical, whether to shade the background for the first
strata in lightgrey, because (for Mediterranean analyses) this is the full
community and the fits were not great, so the results are not so reliable.}

\item{xlim, }{ylim vectors for axes limits; if NULL (the default) they get
calculated automatically.}

\item{x_jitter}{Amount to left/right jitter each strata within a group;
default works great for an example plot, needs generalising TODO}

\item{legend_position}{character description of keyword of where to put
legend using \code{legend()}, one of '"bottomright"', '"bottom"',
'"bottomleft"', '"left"', '"topleft"', '"top"', '"topright"', '"right"'
or '"center"'}

\item{legend_inset}{inset distance(s) from the margins as a fraction of the plot
region when legend is placed by keyword, used as \code{legend(..., inset = legend_inset)}.}

\item{legend_bty}{type of box to be drawn around the legend, either '"o"'
(the default) or '"n"'. Used as \code{legend(..., bty = legend_bty)}.}

\item{xlab}{label for x-axis (default is nothing, as Group headings are
shown at the top}

\item{ylab}{label for y-axis}

\item{y_minor_tick_start}{used as \code{add_minor_tickmarks(..., y_tick_start = y_minor_tick_start)} but is automatically calculated; specify a value if
it needs tweaking}

\item{y_minor_tick_by}{numeric increment of minor tick marks, set to a high
value (like 100) to have no minor tick marks.}

\item{gap_axis}{used as \code{axis(3, gap.axis = gap_axis)} to specify minimal
gap between labels on the top axis}

\description{
A somewhat specific plot for the Mediterranean analyses of five species
groups fitted for three strata, but applicable to other sets of results.
For each group there will be three strata (to do with fishing being
allowed), and we want to see how \emph{b} changes within each group under the
changes in fishing. Bascially plotting out the results saved in
\code{res_tib}. For the Mediterranean analyses we also show the results for the
Full community, but with an option to shade that area in grey because the
fits were not great.

\details{
For doing time series probably best to adapt and make a new function.
