\title{Analyse gaps to look for outliers (large values with gaps from remaining
continuous values) from MLEbins (TODO others to come) results object}
\usage{
detect_outliers(dat, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{sizespectrum_mlebins} object.
##' @return tibble
}

\code{gap_ratio} is gap divided by second largest gapTODO list containing two tibbles plus two numerics. Each tibble contains just the data values needed for
calculations, which are \code{species}, \code{bin_min}, \code{bin_max}, and
\code{bin_count}. \code{count_gte_bin_min} etc. will be recalculated in the new
analysis. They are:
\itemize{
\item \code{dat-keep} records that are being kept
\item \code{dat-removed} records that are removed
Numeric values are:
\item \code{bin_count_removed} sum of the counts in bins that have been removed
\item \code{bin_count_removed_prop} proportion of the counts in bins that have been
removed (total counts removed divided by total counts in original data set).
}}
}
\description{
If already run through remove_outliers.size_spectrum_mlebins then it wil
use \code{detect_outliers.remove_outliers.mlebins()} and can keep iterating that.
