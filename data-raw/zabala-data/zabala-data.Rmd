Now just extracting and then saving the `PesoIndividual` column for each species
group and data set ("baseline", "fg", or "ntr"), as, for example,
`x_community_ntr`. Using the first syllable or so for the longer complex species
group names.

Baseline corresponds to 2017, but don't need to have the
date in the variable name. Doing the analyses in
`report/`, here just saving the data into the package. Each is then just a
vector of individual body masses. Andy adding in `as.numeric()` as just using
`na.omit()` keeps information (as attributes) about the indices (I presume) of
the omitted NA's, which we do not need.

```{r extractjustmasses}
x_community_baseline <- na.omit(resnep17$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()
x_community_fg <- na.omit(resnep21_fg$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()
x_community_ntr <- na.omit(resnep21_ntr$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()


# Chondrichthyes
resnep17_chondrichthyes <- subset(resnep17_chondrichthyes, Talla_mm >100)
x_chondr_baseline <- na.omit(resnep17_chondrichthyes$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()

x_chondr_fg <- na.omit(resnep21_fg_chondrichthyes$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()
# TODO not
                                        # sure why not >100
x_chondr_ntr <- na.omit(resnep21_ntr_chondrichthyes$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()
  # TODO not sure why not >100

# Cephalopoda -- All
x_ceph_all_baseline <- na.omit(resnep17_cephalopoda$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()
x_ceph_all_fg <- na.omit(resnep21_fg_cephalopoda$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()
x_ceph_all_ntr <- na.omit(resnep21_ntr_cephalopoda$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()
```

Carrying on...


```{r continue}

x_ceph_large_baseline <- na.omit(resnep17_cephalopoda_big$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()
x_ceph_large_fg <- na.omit(resnep21_fg_cephalopoda_big$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()

resnep17_actinopterygii <- subset(resnep17_actinopterygii, Talla_mm > 40)

resnep21_fg_actinopterygii <- subset(resnep21_fg_actinopterygii, Talla_mm > 40)
x_actin_fg <- na.omit(resnep21_fg_actinopterygii$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()

resnep21_ntr_actinopterygii <- subset(resnep21_ntr_actinopterygii, Talla_mm >40)

x_crust_fg <- na.omit(resnep21_fg_crustacea$PesoIndividual) %>% as.numeric()

```

Now save the values in the package. Maybe do as a single list. Then use list2env
in analysis.

TODO might not actually want this in the end.

# For MLEbins method, need tibble of species-specific length-weight coefficients

Juliana already did the length-to-weight calculations in the spreadsheet. But we
need to explicitly do them as want the min and max possible weight for each
length bin.

So, using a version of the data that is saved above:

```{r, lwcoeffs}
length_weight_coefficients <- resnep_for_length_weight_coefficients %>%
  dplyr::select(species = NomEspecie,
                alpha = ConstantA_TallaPes,
                beta = ConstantB_TallaPes) %>%
  dplyr::mutate_at(vars(species),
                   factor)

length_weight_coefficients <-
  dplyr::summarise(dplyr::group_by(length_weight_coefficients,
                                   species),
                   alpha = unique(alpha),
                   beta = unique(beta))

length_weight_coefficients
summary(length_weight_coefficients)

mediterranean_length_weight_coefficients <-
  dplyr::filter(length_weight_coefficients,
                !is.na(alpha))

summary(mediterranean_length_weight_coefficients)

usethis::use_data(mediterranean_length_weight_coefficients,
                  overwrite = TRUE)
# TODO document, alpha and beta are the coeffcicients; need to describe units.
# This should be the standard way of using length-weight coefficients.
```

Thought about leaving the NA's in there for now, as a check with Juliana's that
none make it through to the analyses. But remove and just check that she has
none of the NA species TODO.



# For MLEbins method, need the following, looking at Table 1 in MEPS:

species, strata, length bin min, standardised count -- from data

then calculate:
weight bin min, weight bin max, biomass in that bin based on standardised count
(not actually need for likelihood, can leave the calc to plotting functions if
it's needed).

Take the full data set and then save what we need.
```{r, wrangling}

```{r, notes}
# Notes from Juliana's email:

# Frequenciecaculada: 3 means measured 1/3 of the
# catch, or, equivalently (I think)
# there were 3 fish but only 1 was
# measured. So Juliana then creates 3
# individual identical rows in such a
# situation. 1 means no subsampling.

# Each tow covers a different area, we tried to make it so that eachtow last 1
# hour, but there were variations, so we use the trawled area km2 to standardize
# biomass and abundance data.


# 'PesTotalCalculatRelacioTallaPes_g' is the total weight of that species taking
# into account the subsample, meaning that if the total weight is 100g and the
# subsample is 5, 5 organisms of that species weight 100g, so each organism here
# weights 20g. - we won't need that as using length-weight relationships.

# NumeroPesca is Haul Number - not needed

# FrequenciaCalculada - The number of fish of a given length, species and haul is represented in FrequenciaCalculada. That's why I did the calculations on the first question, so that there would be one row for each individual, so using PesoIndividual accounts for everything.


# Abundancia_NIndividusTalla_Km2 this looks to be freq scaled by area of
# trawl, as verified in expect_equal above. If you just do MLE you can't
# take this into account though.

```



Combine rows that have the same strata, species, and length.

# Can see that have two 140s in same strata of same species:
#   dplyr::filter(mediterranean_data[1:100, ], species == "Lepidorhombus boscii", length == 140)
# so worth combining at this
# point. Might be harder to compare results to Juliana's (maybe not?), so can
# always comment this out, though MLEbins figures will be strange -- actually
# wrong as won't be able to see overlapping bins that are the same. So
# definitely need to do this. TODO include automatically in a function somehwere.
# Also mention that this sorts them alphabetically by strata, species, and then
# length.
dat <- dplyr::summarise(group_by(mediterranean_data[1:1000, ],
                                 # Just doing first 100  TODO
                                 strata,
                                 species,
                                 length),
                        bin_count = sum(number)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()
dat
```


HERE (but  - above R code works, haven't run full .Rmd.), though stuff below
works also.  And the Fung
example NEXT

Now combine length-weight coefficients and data. Then functionalise it once
worked out.

First, some lengths in original spreadsheet are to 0.01 mm and some to 1mm. Check
what we get after the refinements here. Given to mm scale, maybe MLEbins is
overkill. But I think the scaling by trawl area will result in non-integer
counts. And given the mixture does seem worth doing.

Can presume that a length to 2 decimal places is measured at resolution of 0.01,
whereas ones that are to integers were measured at resolution of 1 (except for
the 1 in 100 that come out as .00). Though when printed as tibble it keeps the
original format.

Juliana: The lengths with 0.01mm accuracy are all measured crustaceans, as
they're typically small and its the standard to measure them with a vernier
caliper. All other species were measured to the 1mm accuracy, as we used a
standard lab metric tape. So if we have 27 its correct to say it is 27.00. With
this in mind, I would define b) 26.5 - 27.5 mm as the bin value for 27.00.

And for the 0.01 mm accuracy it really isn't going to make much difference
exactly how
we define the bin, so say 26.13 is 26.125-26.135 for consistency. (Have to

```
Okay, so lengths in mm are converted to cm for the length-weight calculations,
and then for total biomass converted to kg, though we won't actually need that directly.

This would seem to have the data in the format required for analysis. We would
actually functionalise some of the above steps, and just require the raw data
and l-w coefficients.

HERE see above TODOs, check with spreadsheet, though wait for reply.

HERE HERE HERE - redo this when done later HERE's

Just want to analyse one strata at a time. Do baseline here then functionalise
to make a loop. TODO. Or maybe do each in turn to keep track for this example.

For a given data set to be fit, do a
function to combine numbers for which we have the same species and length
bin. Can actually do that early on.

```{r, analyse}
dat_baseline <- dplyr::filter(dat_joined,
                              strata == "TBA")

dat_for_mlebins <- dplyr::select(dat_baseline,
                                 species,
                                 bin_count,
                                 bin_min = weight_bin_min,
                                 bin_max = weight_bin_max)

res_mlebins <- fit_size_spectrum(dat_for_mlebins)

> res_mlebins <- fit_size_spectrum_mlebins(dat_for_mlebins)  # should work

res_mlebins
```

HERE HERE HERE Think it's L96 of fit-size-spectrum-mlebins.R

The plot below seemed to work on first plot, but need to dig into code to check it's
correct. See what I did in sizeSpectra when had to adapt MLEbins code to plot
MLEbin results. HERE HERE - actually do Fung first to then check figure and
results match.

```{r plotmlebins}
plot(res_mlebins)
```

## Functionalising those last calculations

Have length-weight coefficients and data in a standard form.



# Check code using dataOrig from sizeSpectra, which is Fung data.

Need to accomodate the 0.5 cm bins though. Just do one year for now. Then write
functions to reproduce resutls for all years, and automatically do all stratea
for Med data.

Note that LngtClas is in mm, not cm, but that a and b are the length-weight
coefficients for the length being in cm. For sizeSpectra vignette used cm as
units later in that code.

First attempt here was using `dataOrig`, but I'd already tidied it up in
`IBTS_data` so second attempt is trying that.

Figured out the bug in this, see the TODO towards the end, but for now carrying
on with chunk after this, as this still has some data-specific wrangling in it.

```{r fungdata, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

# say

# Now have just:
plot(res_fung_mlebins_1999)
```

Woo-hoo, matches Table S.2 and Figure 7.

For figure to work as for MEPS, need to sort by `weight_bin_min` somewhere
above. Makes sense to do at once the weight bins have been calculated. Doing
that in plotting code.

HERE HERE HERE: -
  D check plot,
  D commit,
then work out which version to keep (which is more
generalisable), this one or the next. Then simplify this down, and apply to Med data. Actually make
a new vignette showing it reproduces results from MEPS. Should then
functionalise approach with a strata option.


TODO decide which to keep, this or the above one:
Trying with `IBTS_data`:

```{r, fungibtsdata}

 TODO put a remove bin count or number of 0 in somewhere early when

                                      bin_max = weight_bin_max)

fung_dat_for_mlebins

res_fung_mlebins <- fit_size_spectrum(fung_dat_for_mlebins)

res_fung_mlebins
```

Woo-hoo, that matches Table S.2 of MEPS paper.



TODO HERE may ahve to go back and think about units again. Set up some rules,
maybe convert to cm straight away. Think that's best.
