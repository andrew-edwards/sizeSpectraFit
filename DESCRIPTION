Description: Provides code for fitting size spectra to ecological data using maximum likelihood methods. This is a more user-friendly version of the earlier sizeSpectra package , being written from scratch (rather than adapting old code into a package), and with a focus on applying methods to users' data rather than reproducing results from our earlier papers. The methods used are described and simulation tested in [1] Edwards et al. (Testing and recommending methods for fitting size spectra to data, Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2017, 8:57-67) and [2] Edwards et al. (Accounting for the bin structure of data removes bias when fitting size spectra, Marine Ecology Progress Series, 2020, 636:19-33). See the GitHub site for more details, including rendered versions of the vignettes.
